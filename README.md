# AstroSage Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)

![AstroSage logo]()
## Overview
This project presents an analysis of AstroSage's platform data, including user activity across calls and chats, user behavior (one-time vs. repeat users), and guru performance (based on ratings). The goal is to derive insights to improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.

## Data Analyzed
* User Activity: Breakdown of interactions via calls, chats, complementary services, and live calls.
* Customer Behavior: Proportion of one-time vs. repeat users to identify retention and engagement patterns.
* Performance Metrics: Chat and call status distribution highlighting completion rates, failures, and pending interactions.
* Guru Ratings: Top 10 rated gurus based on user feedback and ratings.
## Key Findings
* Chat interactions represent 69.6% of the total activity, while calls account for 30.3%.
* The call failure rate is significantly high (over 60% of call attempts fail, are incomplete, or are unanswered).
* A close balance exists between one-time (51.1%) and repeat users (48.9%), signaling opportunities for user retention improvements.
* Top-performing gurus receive significantly higher ratings, with Tarot M. and Astro P. standing out with the highest average ratings (7.50).

## Recommendations
1. Improve Call Center Operations: Optimize technology to distribute call volumes more uniformly, enhancing call success rates.
2. Enhance Chat Efficiency: Implement targeted training and support for chat agents to reduce failed and incomplete interactions.
3. Boost User Retention: Develop targeted loyalty programs to convert more one-time users into repeat customers.
4. Focus on Guru Development: Offer performance training to lower-rated gurus to improve service quality and customer satisfaction.
